In a business setting, this would indicate the overall effectiveness of the model in making correct predictions. A high accuracy score would have a positive impact on the business, as it would indicate a high level of confidence in the model's predictions.\n","\n","* **Precision**: This metric indicates the proportion of true positive predictions out of all positive predictions made by the model. In a business setting, this would indicate the level of confidence in the model's ability to identify positive instances correctly. A high precision score would have a positive impact on the business, as it would indicate that the model is not making false positive predictions.\n","\n","* **Recall**: This metric indicates the proportion of true positive predictions out of all actual positive instances. In a business setting, this would indicate the model's ability to identify all positive instances. A high recall score would have a positive impact on the business, as it would indicate that the model is not missing any positive instances.\n","\n","* **F1 Score**: This metric is a combination of precision and recall and is used to balance the trade-off between the two. In a business setting, this would indicate the overall effectiveness of the model in making correct predictions while also avoiding false positives and false negatives. A high F1 score would have a positive impact on the business, as it would indicate that the model is making accurate predictions while also being able to identify all positive instances.\n","\n","* **ROC AUC**: This metric indicates the ability of the model to distinguish between positive and negative instances.

A high ROC AUC score would have a positive impact on the business, as it would indicate that the model is able to correctly classify instances.\n","\n","In summary, the Random Forest Classifier can be considered as an efficient model for the business, especially when it achieves high scores in all of these evaluation metrics, which would indicate that it can accurately predict outcomes, identify all positive instances, and correctly classify instances as positive or negative."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Fze-IPXLpx6K"},"source":["### ML Model - 3 Implementing XgBoost Classifier"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"FFrSXAtrpx6M"},"outputs":[],"source":["# ML Model - 3 Implementation\n","# Create an instance of the RandomForestClassifier\n","xg_model = XGBClassifier()\n","\n","# Fit the Algorithm\n","xg_models=xg_model.fit(X_train,y_train)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"923qu8hHBcs7"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Predict on the model\n","# Making predictions on train and test data\n","\n","y_pred_train5 = xg_models.predict(X_train)\n","y_pred5 = xg_models.predict(X_test)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"B018mSbfBytd"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Predict on the model\n","# Get the predicted probabilities\n","train_probability5 = xg_models.predict_proba(X_train)\n","test_probability5 = xg_models.predict_proba(X_test)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"nso7oDoECCuY"},"outputs":[],"source":["# Calculating accuracy on train and test\n","train_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_train,y_pred_train5)\n","test_accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test,y_pred5)\n","\n","print(\"The accuracy on train dataset is\", train_accuracy)\n","print(\"The accuracy on test dataset is\", test_accuracy)"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7AN1z2sKpx6M"},"source":["#### 1.

In a business setting, this would indicate the level of confidence in the model's ability to identify individuals who are likely to engage with the campaign.

This pattern indirectly influences our target variable as well. It is advisable to dismiss the notion that a person's location plays a role in determining whether they engage with our emails by reading, acknowledging, or ignoring them.\n","\n","Examining the Email Campaign Type feature, it is evident that Campaign Type 1 exhibited a high likelihood of being viewed, even though a relatively small number of emails were dispatched. Conversely, the majority of emails sent under Campaign Type 2 were ignored. Campaign Type 3 demonstrated success, with more emails being read and acknowledged despite a lower volume of emails sent during this campaign.\n","\n","The classification of emails does not consider the timing of email dispatch as a relevant factor, as indicated by both the feature importance and empirical evidence. Emails sent under category 2 in the middle of the day are likely to receive more attention and acknowledgment compared to those sent in categories 1 and 2 during the day.\n","\n","Analyzing past interactions, it becomes apparent that the more emails there are, the higher the likelihood that they will be read and acknowledged. Establishing a meaningful connection with customers is the key focus here.\n","\n","Furthermore, the length of an email correlates with its likelihood of being disregarded; longer emails tend to be ignored. Additionally, ignored emails tend to include more images.\n","\n","With the exception of Word Count, nearly all continuous variables exhibited outliers. After thorough analysis, it was determined that outliers constitute more than 5% of the minority data and could impact results in either direction; hence, it was deemed preferable to retain them.\n","\n","While SMOTE seems to have demonstrated superior performance, it is essential to acknowledge the potential for information loss.\n","\n","In the context of unbalanced data and outliers, the XGBoost algorithm performed optimally, closely followed by the Random Forest Hyperparameter Tuned model, achieving an F1 Score of 0.68 on the test set."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"gIfDvo9L0UH2"},"source":["### ***Hurrah!
